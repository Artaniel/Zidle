2. Gameplay Features
2.1. Core Gameplay Loop
Create Virus: choose perks from the progression tree.
Start infection: choose zero patient or another way to spread the virus.
Observe: your zombies fight and infect civilians.
Collect: dead zombies and infected civilians are dropping useful resources like virus examples with new mutations. 
Macro-control: later in progression the player can use active skills, to prevent enemy reinforcements from arriving, lock or unlock doors, etc.
2.2. Key Mechanics
Virus Evolution: Players customize the virus with perks unlocked through mutations, such as increased infection speed, enhanced zombie durability, or special abilities like emitting toxic clouds. These perks define combat abilities of zombies and are earned by collecting virus samples and achieving specific milestones during gameplay.
Infection System: Infection spread by attack, kill, contact with an infected human, contact with stains of blood after combat, etc. It depends of virus perks.
Resource Collection: Resources like virus samples and mutations drop from defeated zombies and infected humans, fueling upgrades and research.
Active Skills: Player can influence battlefield by skills limited by cooldowns.
Incubation and decay: The virus needs time to convert a human, and can't be held forever. Players can strategically manipulate these variables, opting for faster conversion of combatants or slower, stealthier spread among unconverted populations. These effects can be accelerated or delayed using active skills.
Zombie tiers: Better variants of zombies can be grown with special conditions, like surviving with infection long enough, or accumulating over threshold of zombie kills before conversion.
